**Project Overview**   
Philadelphia is a majority-minority city, in which people of color account for 64.3 percent of the city’s nearly 1.6 million residents. Of this population, an additional 43.9 percent identify as Black, making Philadelphia the third largest urban Black community in the United States. While the city has experienced significant demographic shifts over time, particularly in the wake of white flight and deindustrialization beginning in the 1950s and 1960s, the city’s Black population has remained numerically stable over the past 30 years–until the past decade. Similar to other U.S. cities, recent census data warns of an accelerating pattern of displacement of Black residents from the city’s geographic core to its peripheries, which threatens to dislocate sites and practices of historical and cultural significance to Philadelphia communities. The Re/member Black Philadelphia community archiving collaboration asks how Black residents in the city are “holding place” in the face of expanding gentrification, and how libraries and researchers can support the documentation and preservation of Philadelphia’s increasingly endangered contexts of social and cultural life by engaging residents.


**Project Infrastructure**  
The Re/member Black Philadelphia collaboration is a joint project of the Penn Libraries’ Center for Research Data and Digital Scholarship, University of Pennsylvania’s Graduate School of Education, the Price Lab for the Digital Humanities, and community partners. We are working to develop a model for community engagement that fosters robust partnerships between well-resourced libraries and community organizations that will result in improved documentation of contemporary Black Philadelphia, increased digital access to local historical records, and which will embrace the use of immersive technologies to create new avenues of public engagement with historical records. These approaches will demonstrate how well-resourced memory institutions can amplify the visibility and help sustain unique cultural heritages in ways that foreground public participation, employ social justice frameworks, and work to improve the relationship between large institutions and their surrounding communities, particularly as communities that are underrepresented in existing repositories face various forms of erasure.
